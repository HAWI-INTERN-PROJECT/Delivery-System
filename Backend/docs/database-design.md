# Food & Grocery Delivery Platform

## Database Design Document

**Project:** Food & Grocery Delivery Platform (PWA)
**Team:** Team 3 – 2026 Summer Internship

---

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the database design for the Food & Grocery Delivery Platform. It serves as the foundation for backend development and provides a shared understanding of the database structure before implementation.

The design supports the following user roles:

- Customer
- Restaurant Manager
- Driver
- Administrator

The goal is to define the database tables, relationships, constraints, and business rules that will be implemented using Laravel migrations and MySQL.

---

## 2. Database Design Goals

The database is designed to:

- Support all four user roles using a single `users` table.
- Maintain data integrity through primary and foreign keys.
- Prevent duplicate and inconsistent data.
- Preserve historical order information.
- Support role-based access control.
- Support online payments.
- Support real-time driver location tracking with location history.
- Allow future system expansion without major redesign.
- Provide a reliable foundation for the Laravel REST API.

---

## 3. Database Tables

The application consists of the following tables:

1. `users`
2. `driver_profiles`
3. `restaurants`
4. `categories`
5. `menu_items`
6. `cart_items`
7. `orders`
8. `order_items`
9. `ratings`
10. `payments`
11. `driver_locations`

Laravel may also generate system tables such as:

- `personal_access_tokens`
- `password_reset_tokens`
- `failed_jobs`
- `cache`
- `cache_locks`
- `jobs`
- `job_batches`
- `migrations`

## 3.1 users

### Purpose

Stores all registered users of the platform. Customers, Restaurant Managers, Drivers, and Administrators are represented in this table. The `role` column determines the user's role and permissions.

## 3.9 ratings

### Purpose

Stores customer ratings and optional reviews for menu items purchased through the platform.

The `order_item_id` relationship connects the rating to a specific purchased item. This allows the system to verify that the customer actually purchased the item before submitting a rating.

| Column Name     | Data Type        | Constraints                             | Description                                |

| Column Name             | Data Type       | Constraints                        | Description                                       |

## 3.11 driver_locations

### Purpose

Stores the location history of drivers while they are working. Every location update creates a new record rather than overwriting the previous location.

This allows the system to retrieve the driver's latest location for real-time tracking while also preserving historical location data.

| Column Name         | Data Type       | Constraints                         | Description                          |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| `longitude`         | DECIMAL(10,7)   | NOT NULL                            | Geographic longitude.                |
| `recorded_at`       | TIMESTAMP       | NOT NULL                            | Time when the location was recorded. |
| `created_at`        | TIMESTAMP       | Auto Generated                      | Record creation timestamp.           |
| `updated_at`        | TIMESTAMP       | Auto Generated                      | Record update timestamp.             |

### Indexes

| Column                               | Index Type  | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                                 | Primary Key | Unique record identification.                                            |
| (`driver_profile_id`, `recorded_at`) | INDEX       | Improve retrieval of a driver's location history in chronological order. |

### Foreign Keys

| Column              | References            | On Delete | On Update |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| `driver_profile_id` | `driver_profiles(id)` | CASCADE   | CASCADE   |

### Relationships

- One Driver Profile can have many location records.
- One Driver Location belongs to one Driver Profile.

### Business Rules

- Each location update creates a new record.
- The latest location record represents the driver's current known location.
- Historical location records are retained for tracking and delivery analysis.
- Location data should only be recorded while the driver is active or available for tracking.
- Latitude and longitude must contain valid geographic coordinates.

2. The `role` column determines the user's system role.
3. A driver has one `driver_profile`.
4. `orders.driver_id` references `driver_profiles.id`, not `users.id`.
5. A restaurant is managed by one Restaurant Manager.
6. A customer can have multiple cart items.
7. An order contains one or more order items.
8. Order items preserve the item name and price at the time of purchase.
9. A customer can submit a rating only for a purchased item.
10. Each purchased order item can have at most one rating.
11. Ratings must have a value from 1 to 5.
12. An order can have zero or one payment record.
13. Payment is handled through supported online payment methods.
14. Drivers do not collect cash from customers.
15. Driver location updates are stored as historical records.
16. The latest driver location represents the driver's latest known position.
17. Foreign keys enforce relationships between related records.
18. Appropriate indexes are used to improve common queries.

---

## 6. Database Integrity and Deletion Rules

Foreign key deletion behavior is selected according to the importance of preserving historical data.

- User records related to important historical transactions should generally be protected using `RESTRICT`.
- Driver assignment can be removed from an order using `SET NULL` without deleting the order.
- Deleting a restaurant removes its dependent menu items where appropriate.
- Deleting an order removes its order items and associated payment where appropriate.
- Deleting a driver profile removes its associated location history.
- Ratings remain associated with their purchased order items according to the selected foreign-key rules.

---

## 7. Implementation

The database will be implemented using:

- Laravel 12 migrations
- MySQL
- Eloquent ORM
- Foreign key constraints
- Database indexes
- Unique constraints
- Enum/status fields
- Validation at the application/API layer

The database design should remain synchronized with the ERD, API contract, Laravel migrations, and Eloquent model relationships throughout development.
